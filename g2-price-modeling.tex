\abstract{We analyze G2 spot instance price}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:1}



In this paper, we focus to analyze the predication of spot instances price for 7 regions by use different time series models such as ARIMA, SARIMA VAR, DLM, prophet, average and na√Øve model
our work covered  7 regions of spot instances datasets, ap-northeast-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-regions, and 5 types and different period of datasets G2(03-02 to 2016-10-31),I2(2016-05-03 to 2017-02-04),M4,c3,R3(2016-03-02 to 2017-02-04)








Explain opportunistic cloud computing resources with spot instance in EC2

Mention the difficulies of price change prediction

ARIMA with different parameters 
stander for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, which is the most popular statistical model and widely used to forecasting a time series, the model is a combination of  autoregressive Eq.~\ref{Eq-AR} and moving-average model Eq.~\ref{Eq-MA}, with three parameters  (p,d,q) where p is the number of autoregressive terms, which is depends on past values, d is the degree of differencing and q is the number of lagged forecast errors in the prediction equation, depends only on the random error terms 
\begin{equation}
 y_t = w_0 +\beta_1 y_{t-1}+ \beta_2 y_{t-2}+.....\beta_n y_{t-n}+\epsilon_t
\label{Eq-AR}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
 y_t = w_0 +\epsilon_t + \delta_1 \epsilon_{t-1}+  \delta_2 \epsilon_{t-2}+...+ \delta_n \epsilon_{t-n}
\label{Eq-MA}
\end{equation}

Thus, ARIMA if d=n will be 
\begin{equation}
 y_t = w_0 +\beta_1 y_{t-1}+ \beta_2 y_{t-2}+.....\beta_n y_{t-n} +  \delta_1 \epsilon_{t-1}+  \delta_2 \epsilon_{t-2}+...+ \delta_n \epsilon_{t-n}+
\label{Eq-ARIMA}
\end{equation}
Where the term \(\beta_i \) is, weight applied to prior values in the time series \(\delta_i \) is autocorrelation coefficients at lags and \(\epsilon_i \) is residual error term 
\section{Evaluation}
Compare all the methods of different types of algorithms to different instance types
